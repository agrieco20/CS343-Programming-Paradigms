Description: This program converts numbers 0-255 and converts them into Binary Array Format. For example, "5" is returned as [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1]

#This function "returns" the Binary representation of a decimal number in an array format
def binaryArrayFormatter(currentNum)

  arrayLengthDeterminer = currentNum #Stored in arrayLengthDeterminer
  arrayLengthCounter = 0   #Ensures that the number entered is at least 8 digits in Binary. If not, extra leading zeroes are added. If number in Binary requires more than 8 digits of binary, an extra slot in the Binary Array is allocated for the given decimal number

  while arrayLengthDeterminer > 0
    arrayLengthDeterminer /= 2
      arrayLengthCounter += 1
  end

  #Checks to see if the Decimal conversion into Binary would have under 8 digits (if so, space for leading zeros is allocated)
  if arrayLengthCounter < 8
    arrayLengthCounter = 8

  binaryArrayLengthCounter = binaryArray.length - 1

  #Calculates what the Binary Value of a number should be, assigns the value in reverse order to "binaryArray" and then "returns" it in the following line back to the main program
  while binaryArrayLengthCounter >= 0

    currentNum /= 2
    binaryArrayLengthCounter -= 1
